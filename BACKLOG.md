# DocDelay — Backlog

Ideas and known gaps to pick up later.

## To do

- **A second "doctor unavailable" window on the same day:** the empty-slot search should avoid it. Right now, if a doctor has two absences in one day, a "later today" patient can be given a slot inside the second absence.

## Done

- ✅ **No room today → offer "another day" straight away (Stage 5):** when there's no room left today, the call now apologises and offers 3 other-day slots, instead of only saying "our front desk will call you".
- ✅ **Limit how far a patient is pushed (Stage 5):** an unaffected patient is never pushed more than `MAX_PUSH_MINUTES` (45 minutes) past their original booked time. If fitting a "later today" patient would break this, it counts as "no room today" and other days are offered.
